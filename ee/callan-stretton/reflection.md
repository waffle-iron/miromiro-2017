Why is reflection important?
Reflection helps to solidify both the information you have learned but also picks apart what things you did well in and what things you can improve on. I particularly found reading through my notes from the previous day useful to re-jog my memory.

What did I do well this week?
I skimmed through the tasks first and worked how long roughly each one would take and whether they needed prerequisites. I started the larger tasks first as these ones I knew I wanted to spend more time on. Also I found taking notes useful.

What could I have done to improve?
I could've been a lot more strict on sticking to my time-management techniques.
