Reflection is important to help you cement and understand the lessons of experience. That old adage comes to mind - those who are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat it. So essentially it is a more efficient way to learn.

I was good at asking for help this week. In the past my ego has prevented me from asking questions to the detriment of my learning. Especially for task 1.2 this was necessary. I was also good at overcoming my perfectionist streak - I dove right into the command line even though I was super intimidated.

I could improve by keeping up the momentum. My concern is that I will burn out so I want to be more disciplined with my maintaining outside time, cleaning, healthy eating and exercise.
